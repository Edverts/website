        <h2>Welcome to Edverts, a mobile educational application designed for children.</h2>
        <p class="large">
            This app is meant for your children.<br><br>
            Install it on their phone or tablet and let them play as much as they want, safe in the knowledge that they will not only play, but also improve their mental arithmetic!<br><br>Edverts will periodically ask them to solve a mathematical task, show them an explanation when they get it wrong or let them resume playing when they get it right.<br><br>
            Use the settings to set how often Edverts should be shown (every 15 minutes by default) or set the type and maximum difficulty of the questions asked. Then protect your changes with a password.
